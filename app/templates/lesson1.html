			The theory of special relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. It is based on the assumption

			is observed to be the same no matter the relative motion between the observer and the light source.

			The theory of special relativity holds within and between

				<span class="hoverBox" id="inertial" style="display: none; width: 350px"
					>An inertial frame of reference is a ‘place’ such as on Earth or inside a rocket ship in which all
					of Newton’s laws are valid. Inside an inertial frame of reference an object with no forces acting on
					it will travel at a constant velocity in a straight line.

			The assumption that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames implies that other
			quantities, that might ordinarily appear to be constant, are actually relative between observers within
			different reference frames.
			<br /><br />
			To preserve a constant speed of light between observers moving at a relative speed,

					also the one-dimensional flow of time from past towards future. It is the combination of space and
					time into one ‘place’ that objects can exist within.</span
