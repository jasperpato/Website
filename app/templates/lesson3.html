			If we performed this experiment on a real train, we would not be able to observe a difference in the
			elapsed time for both observers. This is because trains do not travel fast enough to create a noticeable
			dilation of time.
			<br /><br />
			Test this yourself by plugging in the average speed of a train into the
			<span class="hoverBoxLabel" id="lorentzLabel"
				>Lorentz factor
				<span class="hoverBox" id="lorentz" style="display: none">
					The Lorentz factor<br />γ = 1 / sqrt( 1 - v^2 / c^2 )<br />
					is a quantity dependent on the relative speed v between observers, found in the time dilation
					formula t<sub>1</sub> = γ * t<sub>0</sub>

			in a calculator. The result should show up as 1 (but with enough decimal places, it would be ever so
			slightly higher). <br /><br />
			In this final lesson we will explore an example of time dilation in space travel.

			Consider a set of twins, one on a space ship that travels from Earth to another planet and back again,
			and the other left standing on Earth.
			<br /><br />
			The observer on Earth experiences themselves as stationary while their twin is moving away from them,
			and so believes that they are observing proper time. Therefore time must be dilating for their twin, who
			would return from their journey having aged far less than the observer who stayed on Earth.
			<br /><br />
			However due to relative motion, the twin on the spaceship believes it is themselves and their spaceship
			that is stationary while the Earth and their twin zoom away behind them.
			<br /><br />
			They would predict that it is the observer on Earth who would be younger when they reunite. The twins
			can’t both be younger than the other, giving rise to the twins paradox.

	<div id="l3" style="display: none">
		<p>
			It is not a true paradox because only the observer on Earth is correct. The error lies in the fact that
			the spaceship’s motion is not constant — it must stop, turn around, and travel with a different velocity
			to get back to Earth again.
			<br /><br />
			To discover more about this phenomena simply search for 'the twins paradox'.
