			Consider an observer who is inside a moving train, and another observer standing stationary outside of
			the train.
			<br /><br />
			Using the theory of special relativity, they can perform many experiments with light waves that show
			that time is flowing at different rates for each of them.
			<br /><br />
			Here is one such experiment. The observer on the train places a mirror flat on the train floor, and
			flashes a light bulb on the roof of the train such that a light wave travels from the bulb, directly
			down onto the mirror, and back up to the bulb.

			From the observer inside the train’s perspective, the light travelled directly downwards and then
			directly upwards. The distance traveled by the light beam is d<sub>0</sub> = 2h, and the speed it
			travelled at is always constant at c. Using time = distance / speed, the time elapsed for this observer
			is t<sub>0</sub> = 2h / c. <br /><br />
			However the observer outside the train would witness this event in a different way because while the
			light is making its journey up and down, the train is also moving within their reference frame from left
			to right.

		<p>
			The light must travel a larger distance from the stationary observer’s perspective, but the speed of
			light would still be observed to be constant at c. Therefore, the time elapsed between the flash of the
			bulb and the light returning back to the bulb must be larger for the stationary observer than the time
			elapsed for the observer inside the train.
			<br /><br />
			The train, lightbulb and light beam all travel a horizontal distance of vt<sub>1</sub> during the
			elapsed time t<sub>1</sub>, and a vertical distance of 2h. Using trigonometry we can

					(d<sub>1</sub> / 2)^2 = h^2 + (vt<sub>1</sub> / 2)^2<br />
					d<sub>1</sub>^2 / 4 = h^2 + v^2 t<sub>1</sub>^2 / 4<br />
					d<sub>1</sub>^2 = 4h^2 + v^2 t<sub>1</sub>^2<br />
					d<sub>1</sub> = sqrt( 4h^2 + v^2 t<sub>1</sub>^2 )

			for the distance travelled by the light beam as d<sub>1</sub> = sqrt( 4h^2 + v^2 t<sub>1</sub>^2 ).

			Again using distance = speed * time,
			<span class="hoverBoxLabel" id="timeLabel">

			the elapsed time as <br />t<sub>1</sub> = 2h / sqrt( c^2 - v^2 ). <br /><br />
			The two differing elapsed times calculated by the two observers can be
			<span class="hoverBoxLabel" id="dilationLabel"
				>related to each other
				<span class="hoverBox" id="dilation" style="display: none; width: 330px; left: 70%">
					t<sub>0</sub> = 2h / c , t<sub>1</sub> = 2h / sqrt( c^2 - v^2 ) <br /><br />
					t<sub>1</sub> = c / sqrt( c^2 - v^2 ) * 2h / c<br />
					t<sub>1</sub> = c / sqrt( c^2 - v^2) * t<sub>0</sub><br />
					t<sub>1</sub> = 1 / sqrt( (1 / c^2) (c^2 - v^2) ) * t<sub>0</sub><br />
					t<sub>1</sub> = 1 / sqrt( 1 - v^2 / c^2 ) * t<sub>0</sub><br /><br />
					γ = 1 / sqrt( 1 - v^2 / c^2 ) , t<sub>1</sub> = γ * t<sub>0</sub>
				</span> </span
			>, resulting in the equation t<sub>1</sub> = γ * t<sub>0</sub>, where t<sub>1</sub> is the time elapsed
			as observed by the stationary observer, t<sub>0</sub> is the time elapsed for the observer inside the
			train, and γ is a quantity known as the Lorentz factor. <br /><br />
			In this formula, t<sub>0</sub> is named the proper time interval and always refers to the time interval
			observed by the potential observer who witnessed the beginning event (the flash of the light bulb) and
			the ending event (the light wave returning to the bulb) at the same point in space. In this example the
			observer who was inside the train was the one who witnessed these events occurring in the same place, so
			they recorded the proper time interval. The stationary observer witnessed them occurring at different
			places, because the train was moving within their reference frame. <br /><br />
			The ‘proper time’ t<sub>0</sub> is no more 'proper' than any observed t<sub>1</sub>; both elapsed times
			that were calculated were equally valid within their own frames of reference. <br /><br />
